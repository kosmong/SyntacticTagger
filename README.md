# SyntacticTagger

## Description
The project is using HMM to analysis the syntax of a sentence, divide the sentences into chunks, and tag the chunks by their phrase categories.

e.g. I ate an apple. -> B-NP B-VP B-NP I-NP, B means it is the first word of the phrase, I is the rest word of the phrase.

Because the model is too large, it takes a long time to process the sentence.
